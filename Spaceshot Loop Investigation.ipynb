    "This document investigates the Spaceshot Loop using Lagrangian dynamics. We hope to recreate the Spaceshot Loop without accounting for aerodynamic terms to avoid the headaches that would follow from that. Simply put, this is our lazy first shot because air is hard. For a no-prior-experience introduction to the Spaceshot Loop and how we model it here, please see Chandler's [_Spaceshot Loop Dynamics_ guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3nmpmz2pRV-1YVPBqL_L5fdTEglLyGC/view?usp=sharing).
