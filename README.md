# Spaceshot-Lagrangian
Modeling the Spaceshot rocket using Lagrangian mechanics in order to see if the loop is a mechanical or aerodynamic phenomena.

For a primer on Lagrangians, see the PDF by Chandler (@uwu) which provides a background on both the physics as well as motivation for this approach.

Uses SymPyâ€™s LagrangesMethod (https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/mechanics/lagrange.html)

In order to get involved, slack @John Bailey and get on #Spaceshot-Dynamics! Let's go to space!!
