# Spaceshot-Lagrangian
Modeling the Spaceshot rocket using Lagrangian mechanics in order to see if the loop is a mechanical or aerodynamic phenomena.

For a primer on Lagrangians, see the PDF by Chandler (@uwu) which provides a background on both the physics as well as motivation for this approach.
